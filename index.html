                In this section, we take you through some of the ways in which
                you can write using an academic style which is appropriate and
                grammatically correct. We provide you with information on what
                to expect and how to go about achieving a satisfactory academic
                style, including the use of inclusive language.
            </p>
            <p>
                If you come from a background where English is not your first
                language, it will be helpful to you to look at the section on
                common problems in language construction. If you feel your style
                is too informal or colloquial, read the section on making your
                language sound formal and what to avoid. There is also a useful
                guide to using punctuation and for including the ideas from
                research literature in your writing.
            </p>

                the Academic Language and Learning Success Program (ALLSP), who
                run free workshops for internal and external students on English
                language usage as well as developing your skills to edit and
                proofread your assignments.
